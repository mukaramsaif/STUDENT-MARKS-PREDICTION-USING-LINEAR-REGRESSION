# STUDENT-MARKS-PREDICTION-USING-LINEAR-REGRESSION
 Student marks prediction using linear regression, this model helps us to predict the marks of the students using the previous dataset. where in the dataset the inputs are hours(time spent to study) ,age(present age) and internet(weather the internet is available or not), by using these 3 input fields we are predicting the marks of the students.
